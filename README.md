# num.js
Multidimensional array library for engineering computing in Java Script.

This library mimics the interfaces of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for easy use.


## Current Progress
### ndarray

The following methods are implemented in multidimensional array. The operations are the same as numpy methods with the same names.
- flatten()
- reshape()
- transpose()

The following functions are implemented. Their functions do the same operations as numpy functions.
- array()
- zeros()
- ones()
- copy()
- eye()
- add() - element wise addition.
- sub() - element wise subtraction.
- mul() - element wise multiplication.
- div() - element wise division.
- matmul() - matrix multiplcation.
- reshape()
- transpose()
- linalg.inv()
- linalg.solve()



### htest.js
Javascript version of [htest](https://github.com/trip2eee/htest) has been implemented.

Please refer to [readme](htest.js/README.md).

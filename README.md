# num.js
Multidimensional array library for engineering computing in Java Script.

This library mimics the interfaces of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for easy use.


## Current Progress
### ndarray

The following methods are implemented in multidimensional array. The operations are the same as numpy methods with the same names.
- flatten
- reshape
- transpose
- min
- max
- sum
- mean
- std
- var
- clip
- argmin
- argmax
- sort

The following functions are implemented. Their functions do the same operations as numpy functions.
- array
- zeros
- ones
- copy
- eye
- add - element wise addition.
- subtract - element wise subtraction.
- multiply - element wise multiplication.
- divide - element wise division.
- power
- exp
- log
- log10
- log2
- sqrt
- fabs
- sign
- matmul - matrix multiplcation.
- dot - dot product
- sin
- cos
- tan
- arcsin
- arccos
- arctan
- reshape
- transpose
- min
- max
- mean
- argmin
- argmax
- sort
- argsort
- squeeze
- expand_dims
- meshgrid - 2-D only.

### Linear Algebra
- linalg.inv
- linalg.solve



### htest.js
Javascript version of [htest](https://github.com/trip2eee/htest) has been implemented.

Please refer to [readme](htest.js/README.md).
